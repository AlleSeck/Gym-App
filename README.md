# SchoolApp


SchoolApp is a communication tool between the school, students, and their parents. It's a software used by the institution to manage student absences and academic results.

Parents have the opportunity to be involved in their child(ren)'s education by accessing essential information.

Specifically, for a given student, it includes:

Academic results: grades obtained during the semester;
Summary of absences;
Class schedule;
Homework agenda.
The class agenda: regularly filled out by teachers and complementary to the student's agenda, it allows parents to know the homework assigned for home study.

The content of the courses.
